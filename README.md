# Simple Wave Function Collapse Implementation

A *very* rudimentary implementation of a wave function collapseâ€“style procedural generation algorithm. The tile arrangement and connection contraints are based on some examples I watched on YouTube a while back, but I didn't reference those videos while writing this code.

No special libraries or anything, just HTML5/CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
